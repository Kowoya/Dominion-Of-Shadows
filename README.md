                                                        About game

The player lives in a city where reality and a magical underground world coexist. There are university fraternities that practise ancient rituals, and at the same time, there is the threat of an uncontrolled invasion of demonic entities.
The player is a newcomer to the secret House, investigating conspiracies, studying rituals, and fighting creatures from the other side. The key choice: to follow the path of protection or obsession.

                                                        Background

The city of Elior was built at the intersection of worlds: beneath its university, portals leading to the Shadow Dimension have been hidden since ancient times. It was there that the Orders — the Houses — were born, each with its own forbidden rituals.
For centuries, the balance was maintained: the Houses waged a hidden struggle for influence, while ordinary residents were unaware of the existence of another reality.
But in recent years, demonic rifts have begun to appear: entities burst out of them and possess people, causing madness and cruelty

                                                           Player

You are a recruit of the Ninth House, an order specialising in the most dangerous and dark rituals.
You were chosen for a reason: you have the ‘Mark of the Shadow’ — a rare ability to see and interact with spirits.
Your task is to uncover the conspiracy, stop the rifts, and decide whether you will remain a defender of the people or surrender yourself to the dark forces.
